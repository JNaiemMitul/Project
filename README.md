# Project
Project Title: "Student Performance Analysis" - ( 11724140312 )

Objective
Create a Python program to analyze student performance data using core Python concepts, including file handling, data structures, functions, loops, and logical operations.

Project Tasks
1. Data Collection and Storage
Simulate or gather a CSV file with student performance data, including:
Student Name, Student ID
Subject, Score, Attendance Percentage
Assignment Completion (Yes/No)

2. Basic Data Handling
Use File Handling to:
Read the CSV file.
Write modified or updated data back to a new CSV file.

3. Data Analysis and Manipulation
Use lists, dictionaries, or other Python data structures to:
Analyze average, minimum, and maximum scores per student.
Identify students with attendance < 75% or missing assignments.
Filter students failing a specific subject.
Convert Score values to integers if they are stored as strings.

4. Applying Functions and Logic
Implement Functions for:
Calculating aggregate scores for each student.
Determining grades (A/B/C/Fail) based on scoring criteria.
Generating student performance reports in a user-friendly format.

5. Interactive Console Input/Output
Allow the user to:
Add a new studentâ€™s data via console inputs.
Search for a student by name or ID.
Update a student's score or attendance.
